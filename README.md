# Corrupted
 Lets your world slowly be corrupted by crimson, warped and mycelium
 Minecraft version 1.18.1 (spigot/bukkit)
## Features
 Upon bringing any natural crimson or warped blocks to the overworld,
 or even just letting a few mushroom/mycelium spores touch the land (rip dark oak forests),
 the fungi will start to spread.
Try to stop it before it is too late and the spread becomes unstoppable.
 Revert the contaminated world back by using your bone meal gun, which you can
 create by putting a bone meal into an enchanting table.
 Although this can combat the effects, your world will never quite look the same.
## Notes
 As a lot of blocks maybe checked and/or changed per game tick, especially when using the bone meal
 gun, performance on low-end servers might arise.

 Please backup your world before installing this plugin, as it contains world altering features that
 might be impossible to reverse.
### TODO
 - add config file/commands for spread rate and possibly gun radius
 - config file for block conversion types (customizability)
 - improve performance
 - probably a ton of refactoring due to bad code design
